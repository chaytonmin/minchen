<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am currently an Assistant Researcher at Institute of Computing Technology (ICT), Chinese Academy of Sciences, and I am a Postdoctoral Fellow with Prof. Yu Hu. Before this, I obtained a Ph.D. from the School of Computer Science at Peking University in 2024, under the supervision of Prof. Bin Dai. In 2017, I obtained my M.Sc. degree at the School of Computer Science, Beijing Jiaotong University, under the supervision of Prof. Liping Jing. 
I obtained my Bachelor's degree in Energy and Power Engineering from Xi'an Jiaotong University in 2016. My research interest includes Autonomous Driving and Embodied Intelligence.
